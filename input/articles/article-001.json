  "content": "Finding the right marathon shoe becomes increasingly important as we age. Women over 40 often need more cushioning, better stability, and shoes that accommodate changing foot shapes. After testing dozens of options, here are our top picks.\n\n#1 Best Overall: Brooks Ghost 15\nThe Brooks Ghost 15 remains our top pick for women over 40 running marathons. The DNA LOFT cushioning provides exceptional shock absorption without feeling mushy. It's neutral enough for most runners but offers subtle guidance. The mesh upper is breathable and accommodates wider feet well. Price: $140\n\n#2 Best for Stability: ASICS Gel-Kayano 30\nIf you need motion control, the Gel-Kayano 30 is unmatched. The 4D Guidance System provides support without feeling restrictive. GEL technology in the heel absorbs impact beautifully. It runs slightly narrow, so consider going half size up. Price: $160\n\n#3 Best Cushioning: Hoka Bondi 8\nThe maximal cushioning trend works perfectly for mature runners. The Bondi 8 offers a plush ride that protects joints during long training runs. The Meta-Rocker technology promotes a smooth gait cycle. Some find it too soft for speedwork. Price: $165\n\n#4 Best Value: Saucony Ride 16\nAt $140, the Ride 16 delivers premium performance. PWRRUN cushioning is responsive yet protective. The fit is true to size and works for medium to slightly wide feet. A reliable workhorse for daily training and race day. Price: $140\n\n#5 Best for Wide Feet: New Balance Fresh Foam 1080v13\nNew Balance consistently offers the best wide sizing options. The 1080v13 comes in multiple widths and provides excellent cushioning. The Hypoknit upper hugs the foot securely. Great for runners with bunions or toe splay. Price: $165\n\n#6 Best Lightweight: Nike Pegasus 40\nA classic that keeps improving. The Pegasus 40 balances cushioning with responsiveness. React foam provides energy return while Zoom Air units add bounce. Versatile enough for easy runs and tempo workouts. Price: $130\n\n#7 Best for Plantar Fasciitis: Brooks Adrenaline GTS 23\nThe GuideRails support system helps with overpronation without being overly controlling. Many runners report relief from plantar fasciitis symptoms. DNA LOFT cushioning is soft but supportive. Price: $140\n\n#8 Also Consider: Mizuno Wave Rider 27\nMizuno's Wave Plate technology provides unique stability and cushioning. The ride feels different from foam-based shoes - more responsive and bouncy. Takes some adjustment but loyal fans swear by it. Price: $140\n\n#9 Also Consider: On Cloudmonster\nThe Swiss brand's maximalist option. CloudTec pods provide cushioning with good ground feel. The rocker geometry encourages forward motion. Stylish design for those who care about aesthetics. Price: $170\n\n#10 Budget Pick: ASICS Gel-Nimbus 25\nOften available at discount, the Nimbus 25 offers excellent cushioning with FF BLAST+ foam. Pure GEL technology in heel and forefoot. A bit heavier than competitors but very durable. Price: $160 (often on sale)",
