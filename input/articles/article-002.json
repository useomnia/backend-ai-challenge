  "content": "The ASICS Gel-Nimbus has been a go-to neutral cushioned trainer for decades, and version 26 continues that legacy with meaningful updates.\n\nFirst Impressions\nOut of the box, the Nimbus 26 feels noticeably lighter than its predecessor. ASICS trimmed weight by optimizing the FF BLAST PLUS ECO foam stack. The upper uses a new engineered mesh that's more breathable while maintaining structure.\n\nOn the Run\nI tested the Nimbus 26 over 100 miles, including long runs up to 18 miles. The cushioning is exceptional - soft enough for joint protection but with enough resilience to not feel dead. The PureGEL technology under the heel absorbs impact smoothly.\n\nThe ride is decidedly neutral. Runners needing stability should look elsewhere (consider the Kayano 30 instead). For neutral runners, the platform provides a smooth heel-to-toe transition.\n\nFit and Comfort\nASICS addressed previous complaints about narrow fit. The 26 runs more true to size with a roomier toe box. I'd still recommend trying them on, as some runners find ASICS runs small. The heel counter locks the foot in place without irritation.\n\nDurability\nAfter 100 miles, the outsole shows minimal wear. The foam hasn't compressed noticeably. I expect 400-500 miles from this pair, which is excellent for the category.\n\nPros:\n- Excellent cushioning for long distances\n- Improved breathability\n- Lighter than previous version\n- Durable outsole\n- Good for mature runners needing joint protection\n\nCons:\n- Still runs slightly narrow despite improvements\n- Not ideal for speedwork\n- Premium price point at $160\n- Limited color options\n\nThe Verdict\nThe ASICS Gel-Nimbus 26 is one of the best cushioned neutral trainers available. It's particularly well-suited for runners over 40 who prioritize comfort and joint protection over speed. If you loved previous Nimbus versions, you'll appreciate the refinements here.\n\nRating: 4.5/5 stars\nBest for: Daily training, long runs, marathon training\nNot ideal for: Speedwork, runners needing stability",
