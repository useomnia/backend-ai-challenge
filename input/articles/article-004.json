  "content": "Choosing the right running shoes becomes more critical as we age. Dr. Sarah Mitchell, sports podiatrist with 20 years of experience, explains what changes in our 40s and how to adapt.\n\nHow Feet Change After 40\n\nSeveral physiological changes affect shoe selection:\n\n1. Natural padding on the heel and ball of foot diminishes, requiring more shoe cushioning\n2. Ligaments lose elasticity, potentially causing arch collapse\n3. Feet often widen and may increase half a size\n4. Recovery takes longer, making impact protection crucial\n\nKey Features to Look For\n\nCushioning\nPrioritize shoes with substantial midsole cushioning. Brands like Hoka pioneered maximalist cushioning, but traditional brands have caught up. The Brooks Glycerin, ASICS Gel-Nimbus, and New Balance Fresh Foam 1080 all offer excellent shock absorption.\n\nStability\nMany runners develop mild overpronation with age. Consider shoes with light stability features like the Brooks Adrenaline GTS or ASICS GT-2000. These provide guidance without being overly controlling.\n\nFit and Width\nDon't assume your old size still fits. Get measured at a specialty running store. New Balance and Brooks offer excellent width options. The Nike Pegasus and ASICS Nimbus have improved their toe boxes in recent versions.\n\nWeight vs. Protection Trade-off\nLighter shoes like the Nike Vaporfly or Saucony Endorphin Pro may be tempting for race day, but prioritize protection over speed for daily training. Save lightweight racers for special occasions if you use them at all.\n\nRecommended Shoes by Category\n\nNeutral Cushioned:\n- Brooks Ghost 15 - Versatile, great cushioning\n- ASICS Gel-Nimbus 26 - Plush ride, durable\n- Hoka Clifton 9 - Light yet cushioned\n\nStability:\n- Brooks Adrenaline GTS 23 - Best-selling stability shoe\n- ASICS Gel-Kayano 30 - Maximum support\n- Saucony Guide 16 - Lightweight stability\n\nMaximum Cushion:\n- Hoka Bondi 8 - Most cushioning available\n- New Balance Fresh Foam More v4 - Plush and wide\n- ASICS Gel-Nimbus 26 - Reliable comfort\n\nReplacement Schedule\n\nReplace shoes every 300-400 miles. As cushioning materials age, they lose protective properties. Keep a log of mileage on each pair. Some runners rotate two pairs to extend life and allow foam recovery between runs.\n\nFinal Advice\n\nDr. Mitchell emphasizes: 'The best shoe is the one that fits your foot and running style. Price and brand matter less than proper fit. Visit a specialty store, get a gait analysis, and don't be afraid to try multiple options.'",
