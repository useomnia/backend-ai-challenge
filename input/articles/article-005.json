  "source_type": "comparison",
  "content": "Two of the most popular neutral cushioned trainers go head-to-head. Both the Brooks Ghost 15 and ASICS Gel-Nimbus 26 target the same runner: someone wanting plush cushioning for daily training and long runs. Which should you choose?\n\nQuick Comparison\n| Feature | Brooks Ghost 15 | ASICS Gel-Nimbus 26 |\n|---------|-----------------|---------------------|\n| Weight | 9.1 oz (W) | 9.4 oz (W) |\n| Drop | 12mm | 8mm |\n| Cushioning | DNA LOFT v2 | FF BLAST+ / PureGEL |\n| Price | $140 | $160 |\n| Best For | Versatility | Maximum cushion |\n\nCushioning\nBoth shoes excel at cushioning but feel different. The Ghost 15 uses DNA LOFT v2 foam - responsive yet protective. It adapts to your stride and temperature. The Nimbus 26 combines FF BLAST+ foam with PureGEL units for a softer, more plush ride. The Nimbus feels more cushioned; the Ghost feels more balanced.\n\nWinner: ASICS Gel-Nimbus 26 for pure cushioning, Brooks Ghost 15 for versatility\n\nFit\nThe Ghost 15 fits most feet well out of the box. Medium width with a roomy toe box. ASICS traditionally runs narrow, but the Nimbus 26 improved significantly. Still, wider-footed runners may prefer Brooks.\n\nWinner: Brooks Ghost 15\n\nDurability\nBoth are durable. The Ghost uses segmented crash pad rubber; the Nimbus uses AHAR+ rubber. Expect 400-500 miles from either. The Nimbus foam seems to hold up slightly better over time.\n\nWinner: Tie\n\nVersatility\nThe Ghost handles everything from recovery runs to tempo workouts. Its moderate cushioning works across paces. The Nimbus is best for easy and long runs - it's too soft for speedwork. If you want one shoe for everything, choose Brooks.\n\nWinner: Brooks Ghost 15\n\nPrice\nAt $140 vs $160, Brooks offers better value. Both are often discounted, but Ghost sales are more common.\n\nWinner: Brooks Ghost 15\n\nFor Women Over 40\nBoth shoes are excellent choices for mature runners needing joint protection. The Nimbus offers more cushioning for those with existing joint issues. The Ghost is better if you want versatility and value.\n\nOur Recommendation\n- Choose Brooks Ghost 15 if: You want a versatile daily trainer, prefer a firmer ride, value price, or have wider feet\n- Choose ASICS Gel-Nimbus 26 if: You prioritize maximum cushioning, run mostly easy pace, have narrow-to-normal feet, or have significant joint concerns\n\nOverall Winner: Brooks Ghost 15 (better value and versatility)\nClose Runner-Up: ASICS Gel-Nimbus 26 (superior cushioning)",
