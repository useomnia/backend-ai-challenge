  "content": "Original Post by u/newrunner_44:\nRecently got back into running at 44. Previously wore whatever was on sale. Now doing 25-30 mpw training for a half marathon. Narrowed it down to HOKA or brooks but overwhelmed by options. Thoughts?\n\n---\n\nu/shoe_nerd_2020:\nDepends what you want:\n- Maximum cushion: Bondi 8 or Glycerin 20\n- Balanced/versatile: Clifton 9 or Ghost 15\n- Light stability: Arahi or Adrenaline\n\nThe ghost is probably the safest choice for most people.\n\n---\n\nu/marathoner_at_50:\nI've run in both brands extensively. Key differences:\n- hoka has more rocker, propels you forward\n- Brooks is more traditional, stable platform\n- hokas run narrow, brooks fits wider\n\nAt 50, I prefer Ghost for daily training and the clifton for long runs.\n\n---\n\nu/running_physio:\nPT who works with many runners over 40. Both brands are excellent. The most important thing is fit. Common issues I see:\n- bondi: Too soft for some, causes instability\n- ghost: Great all-rounder but not enough cushion for joint issues\n- Hoka Clifton: Sweet spot for many older runners\n\nGet fitted at a specialty store.\n\n---\n\nu/experienced_40plus:\nMy rotation at 47:\n1. Ghost 15 - daily trainer\n2. Mach 5 - tempo/speed days\n3. Triumph 21 - long runs\n\nDon't limit yourself to one brand. Mix and match.\n\n---\n\nu/ultrarunner_mom:\n52F here, running ultras. Speedgoat for trails, glycerin for roads. The brooks Glycerin is incredibly plush - more cushioned than the Ghost. Worth the extra money if you do lots of long runs.\n\n---\n\nu/newrunner_44 (OP):\nThanks all! Sounds like Ghost is the safe bet. Will try Clifton too for comparison. Appreciate the PT input - will definitely get fitted.\n\n---\n\nu/comeback_runner_46:\nJust my experience: tried the Bondi, too unstable for me. Switched to New Balance Fresh Foam 1080v13 and love it. Sometimes the most popular isn't best for you.\n\n---\n\nu/budget_runner_42:\nHey OP, also check previous year models for discounts. Ghost 14 and Clifton 8 are often $100 or less. Same great shoes.",
