  "source_type": "comparison",
  "content": "Saucony makes two excellent neutral trainers: the cushioned Triumph and the versatile Ride. Which fits your running needs?\n\nOverview\nThe Triumph is Saucony's premium cushioned trainer, competing with the Brooks Glycerin and ASICS Gel-Nimbus. The Ride is their versatile daily trainer, similar to the Brooks Ghost and Nike Pegasus. Both use PWRRUN+ foam but in different amounts.\n\nCushioning Comparison\nTriumph 21: 35mm heel / 27mm forefoot (8mm drop)\nRide 16: 32mm heel / 24mm forefoot (8mm drop)\n\nThe 3mm difference is noticeable. The Triumph provides a plusher, more protective ride. The Ride feels more connected to the ground while still being well-cushioned.\n\nWeight\nTriumph 21: 9.7 oz (women's)\nRide 16: 8.1 oz (women's)\n\nThe Ride is significantly lighter, making it better for faster workouts and runners who prefer less shoe.\n\nFit\nBoth fit true to size with medium width. The Triumph has a more padded collar and tongue, creating a luxury feel. The Ride is simpler but comfortable. Wide options available for both.\n\nDurability\nExpect 400-500 miles from either. The Triumph's thicker foam may compress slightly over time. The Ride's outsole coverage is more extensive.\n\nPrice\nTriumph 21: $160\nRide 16: $140\n\nBoth offer good value but the Ride is more accessible.\n\nRecommendations By Runner Type\n\nChoose Triumph 21 if:\n- You run mostly easy pace\n- You're training for marathons\n- You're over 40 seeking joint protection\n- You want maximum comfort\n- You're a heavier runner\n\nChoose Ride 16 if:\n- You want one shoe for all workouts\n- You prefer responsive cushioning\n- Weight matters to you\n- You're budget-conscious\n- You like variety in your training paces\n\nFor Women Over 40\nBoth are excellent choices. The Triumph provides more protection for high mileage and sensitive joints. The Ride offers versatility for those who want to do everything in one shoe.\n\nVerdict\nThe Ride 16 wins for versatility and value. The Triumph 21 wins for pure cushioning comfort. Neither is objectively better - it depends on your priorities.\n\nOur Pick: Saucony Ride 16 for most runners; Triumph 21 for those prioritizing comfort over everything else.",
