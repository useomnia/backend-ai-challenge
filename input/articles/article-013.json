  "content": "Original Post by u/hurting_heels_42:\nDeveloped plantar fasciitis 3 months ago. PT says I can start running again but need supportive shoes. Currently in Nike Frees which my PT says are the worst choice. Budget up to $180. Help!\n\n---\n\nu/pf_survivor_47:\nHad the same issue at 47. My path back:\n1. Adrenaline GTS 23 - the GuideRails helped immediately\n2. Wore Bondis for walking around\n3. Night splints for sleeping\n\nTook 6 months but I'm running pain-free now. The brooks adrenaline was key.\n\n---\n\nu/running_podiatrist:\nPodiatrist who runs here. For plantar fasciitis recovery:\n\nRecommended:\n- Adrenaline GTS (stability + cushion)\n- gel-kayano (more support if needed)\n- HOKA Bondi (maximum cushion for sensitive feet)\n- NB 860 (good stability + width options)\n\nAvoid:\n- Minimalist shoes (Free, Vibram FiveFingers, etc.)\n- Worn-out shoes\n- Flat shoes without arch support\n\nConsider custom orthotics if standard shoes aren't enough.\n\n---\n\nu/comeback_queen_45:\nBrooks Ghost saved my running. Added Superfeet insoles for extra arch support. Went from barely walking to running a half marathon in 8 months.\n\n---\n\nu/datadriven_runner:\nI tracked what worked for the PF community:\n- Adrenaline: Most recommended\n- Bondi 8: Second most\n- Kayano: Third\n- new balance 990v6: Also popular\n\nCommon theme: cushioning + some stability.\n\n---\n\nu/slowhealer_runner:\n45F, had PF for a year. Tried everything:\n- Ghost: Good but not enough support\n- Nimbus 26: Nice cushion but neutral\n- BROOKS Adrenaline GTS: WINNER - finally no pain\n- Clifton: Okay but prefer Adrenaline\n\nThe mild stability really makes a difference.\n\n---\n\nu/hurting_heels_42 (OP):\nSeems like Adrenaline is the consensus. Will try those first. Thank you all!\n\n---\n\nu/masters_coach:\nCoach specializing in masters runners. PF is common over 40 as our fat pads thin. Beyond shoes:\n- Calf stretches daily\n- Roll foot on frozen water bottle\n- Strengthen intrinsic foot muscles\n- Gradual mileage increase\n\nGood luck with recovery!",
