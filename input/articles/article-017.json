  "content": "Original Post by u/curious_runner_45:\nSee so many people wearing On shoes at races. Currently in Brooks Ghost, which I like but want to try something new. Are On shoes good for marathon training? Worth the premium price?\n\n---\n\nu/on_skeptic_47:\nTried them at 47, returned them. The CloudTec pods feel weird underfoot - like running on bubble wrap. Went back to my ASICS Nimbus. Very personal though, some people love them.\n\n---\n\nu/on_convert_42:\n42F and switched from Brooks to On Cloudmonster. LOVE them. The cushioning is different but excellent once you adjust. The rocker helps my aging knees. Worth trying on at least.\n\n---\n\nu/shoe_industry_insider:\nMarketing > innovation with On, honestly. The technology isn't revolutionary. You're paying for Swiss branding. Brooks, ASICS, Nike have similar or better cushioning tech at lower prices.\n\nThat said, if you like how they feel, that matters more than specs.\n\n---\n\nu/running_physio_pro:\nPT perspective: On shoes are fine for some runners. Concerns I see:\n- CloudTec pods collect debris (pebbles)\n- Less cushion than equivalent Hoka/Brooks\n- Heel strikers often don't like them\n\nFor masters runners, I generally recommend more traditional cushioning like Brooks Ghost, Hoka Clifton, or ASICS Nimbus first.\n\n---\n\nu/on_superfan_50:\n50F, 4 years in On shoes. Cloudflyer for stability, Cloudmonster for long runs. No complaints. People criticize them without trying them. Go to a store and run in them.\n\n---\n\nu/numbers_runner:\nI've tracked this sub's opinions:\n- Brooks Ghost: Consistently recommended, minimal complaints\n- On shoes: Polarizing - love or hate\n- Hoka: Generally positive for cushioning\n- ASICS: Reliable but narrow fit complaints\n\nIf you like your Ghost, maybe try Glycerin or Hoka Clifton for something new but proven.\n\n---\n\nu/curious_runner_45 (OP):\nInteresting mix of opinions! Will try them on at my local store. Maybe I'll stick with Brooks if On feels weird. Thanks everyone!\n\n---\n\nu/longtime_runner_55:\n55F marathoner. Life's too short for uncomfortable shoes. I tried On Cloudstratus, found them gimmicky. Brooks Glycerin and Saucony Triumph work better for me. Tried and true beats trendy.",
