  "content": "Original Post by u/masters_marathoner_43:\n43F running 50 miles per week training for Boston. Currently only using Brooks Ghost for everything. Coach says I need a rotation. What's your setup?\n\n---\n\nu/bq_chaser_48:\n48F, 3:15 marathoner. My rotation:\n1. ASICS Nimbus - easy days (60% of miles)\n2. Saucony Kinvara - tempo/intervals\n3. Nike Vaporfly - race day only\n4. Hoka Bondi - recovery runs after long efforts\n\nFour shoes sounds excessive but each serves a purpose.\n\n---\n\nu/efficiency_runner_45:\nUnpopular opinion: rotation is overrated for amateur runners. I use Brooks Ghost for everything including marathons. Finished Boston 3:22 at 45. The Ghost is versatile enough.\n\nSave money, simplify life.\n\n---\n\nu/running_scientist:\nResearch supports rotation. Different shoes stress different muscles/tendons, reducing repetitive strain injury risk. At 50mpw and 40+, this matters.\n\nMinimum recommendation:\n- Daily trainer (Ghost, Nimbus, Ride)\n- Long run shoe with more cushion (Bondi, Glycerin)\n\nOptional:\n- Speed shoe if doing workouts\n\n---\n\nu/coach_masters_runners:\nCoach here specializing in 40+ athletes. For 50mpw marathoner:\n\n1. Daily trainer - 40% of miles (Brooks Ghost, ASICS Nimbus, Saucony Ride)\n2. Long run shoe - 30% of miles (Hoka Bondi, Brooks Glycerin, New Balance 1080)\n3. Tempo/workout shoe - 20% of miles (Saucony Endorphin Speed, Brooks Hyperion)\n4. Easy/recovery - 10% of miles (most cushioned option)\n\nThis distributes stress and optimizes training stimulus.\n\n---\n\nu/injury_prone_46:\nRotation saved my running at 46. Kept getting injured using one shoe. Now I rotate:\n- Monday: Brooks Adrenaline\n- Tuesday: Hoka Mach\n- Wednesday: off\n- Thursday: Brooks Ghost\n- Friday: Saucony Triumph\n- Weekend long: Hoka Clifton\n\nNo injuries in 18 months.\n\n---\n\nu/masters_marathoner_43 (OP):\nGreat insights. Sounds like minimum two shoes, ideally three. Will add a cushioned long run shoe (looking at Glycerin or Bondi) and maybe something for speed days.\n\n---\n\nu/minimalist_runner_50:\n50F, run in New Balance Beacon (minimal cushion). Different strokes. Know your body. Some of us don't need max cushion. Others absolutely do. Experiment carefully.",
