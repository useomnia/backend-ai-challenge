  "source_type": "guide",
  "content": "Nike Inc (NYSE: NKE) reported Q1 2024 earnings that beat analyst expectations. Here's our analysis of whether the athletic apparel giant is a buy.\n\nEarnings Summary\nNike reported revenue of $13.4 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Direct-to-consumer sales grew 25%, showing the company's strategy is working. China sales rebounded strongly.\n\nCompetitive Position\nNike maintains market leadership in athletic footwear. Key competitors include:\n\n- Adidas (ADDYY): Struggling after Yeezy partnership ended. Nike gaining market share.\n- Under Armour (UAA): Focused on performance apparel, less direct competition.\n- Puma (PMMAF): Growing but much smaller scale.\n- New Balance: Private company, strong in running category.\n- Skechers (SKX): Budget segment, different target market.\n\nIn the running specialty channel, Nike competes with Brooks (owned by Berkshire Hathaway), ASICS, and Hoka (owned by Deckers Outdoor). These brands dominate specialty running stores while Nike leads in general athletic retail.\n\nValuation\nAt current prices, Nike trades at 28x forward earnings. This premium is justified by:\n- Brand strength and pricing power\n- Growing DTC channel\n- Innovation pipeline (Alphafly, Pegasus lines)\n- International growth opportunities\n\nRisks\n- Inventory management challenges\n- China regulatory uncertainty\n- Competition from On Running and Hoka in performance running\n- Consumer discretionary spending concerns\n\nOur Rating: BUY\nPrice Target: $128 (20% upside)\n\nDisclosure: Author holds no position in NKE or mentioned securities.",
