  "content": "Original Post by u/firstmarathon45:\nI'm 46F and training for my first marathon. Been running in Nike Free runs for years but my knees are starting to complain during long runs. What shoes do you all recommend? Budget around $150.\n\n---\n\nu/veteranrunner52:\nI switched to Brooks Ghost at 48 and never looked back. The cushioning is amazing without being too soft. My IT band issues disappeared. Highly recommend.\n\n---\n\nu/marathonmom2024:\nHoka Bondi changed my life! I was skeptical about the thick sole but it's so comfortable for long miles. I'm 51 and completed my third marathon in them last year.\n\n---\n\nu/physio_runner:\nPhysical therapist here who also runs. For older runners, I generally recommend:\n1. Brooks Ghost or Glycerin for neutral feet\n2. ASICS Kayano for overpronation\n3. New Balance 1080 if you need wide sizing\n\nAvoid minimalist shoes like your Nike Frees - you need more cushioning as joints age.\n\n---\n\nu/ultradistance_jane:\nAnother vote for ASICS. I'm 49 and rotate between Nimbus for easy days and Novablast for faster workouts. The Nimbus is incredibly cushioned.\n\n---\n\nu/bargainhunter_runs:\nCheck out Saucony Ride or Triumph - often on sale and excellent quality. I got my Triumph 21 for $100 and they're amazing.\n\n---\n\nu/firstmarathon45 (OP):\nThanks everyone! Sounds like Brooks Ghost and Hoka Bondi are the favorites. Going to try both at my local running store.\n\n---\n\nu/runcoach_mary:\nCoach here - whatever you choose, make sure to get properly fitted. Foot mechanics change as we age. Many stores offer gait analysis. Also consider the Brooks Adrenaline GTS if you have any stability needs.\n\n---\n\nu/slowandsteady_55:\nI'll throw in Mizuno Wave Rider as an option people overlook. Different feel than foam shoes but great support. I'm 55 and it's been my go-to for 5 years.\n\n---\n\nu/kneerehab_runner:\nPost knee surgery at 47, my orthopedist specifically recommended Hoka for the cushioning. Clifton or Bondi depending on how much cushion you want. Game changer for protecting joints.",
