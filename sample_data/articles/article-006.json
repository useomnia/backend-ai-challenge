  "content": "The Hoka Bondi 8 represents the pinnacle of maximalist cushioning. For runners seeking the most protection available, this is your shoe.\n\nDesign Philosophy\nHoka pioneered the thick-soled running shoe trend, and the Bondi is their most cushioned road offering. The 8th iteration refines the formula with new foam and an updated upper.\n\nThe Ride\nThe Bondi 8 provides an incredibly plush experience. The compression-molded EVA midsole absorbs everything. Running on concrete feels like running on a track. The Meta-Rocker geometry keeps you moving forward despite the thick stack height.\n\nFor marathon training, this shoe excels during long runs when legs are tired. The cushioning stays consistent mile after mile. However, if you want to pick up the pace, the Bondi fights you. It's not a shoe for speedwork or racing.\n\nUpper and Fit\nThe engineered mesh upper improved from the Bondi 7. More breathable and softer. The fit is medium width with adequate toe room. The heel collar is padded generously - some love it, others find it bulky.\n\nWeight Penalty\nAt 10.3 oz for women, the Bondi 8 is heavy. You feel the weight, especially late in runs. This is the trade-off for maximum cushioning. Runners prioritizing speed should look at the Clifton 9 instead.\n\nDurability\nOutsole rubber is durable; expect 400+ miles. The foam holds up well, though it softens over time. Some runners report the cushioning feeling less protective after 300 miles.\n\nIdeal Runner Profile\n- Runners over 40 seeking joint protection\n- High mileage trainers\n- Heavier runners\n- Recovery days\n- Runners with previous injuries\n\nNot Recommended For\n- Speed workouts\n- Racing\n- Runners preferring ground feel\n- Minimalist enthusiasts\n\nComparison to Competitors\nThe Bondi offers more cushioning than the Brooks Glycerin or ASICS Gel-Nimbus. It's comparable to the New Balance Fresh Foam More v4. The difference is Hoka's rocker geometry, which some prefer.\n\nFinal Verdict\nThe Hoka Bondi 8 delivers on its promise: maximum cushioning for long-distance comfort. It's the best choice for runners prioritizing protection over performance. Mature runners, injury-prone athletes, and high-mileage trainers will appreciate what Hoka has built here.\n\nRating: 4/5 stars\nPrice: $165",
