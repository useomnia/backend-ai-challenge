  "content": "Original Post by u/newrunner_44:\nRecently got back into running at 44. Previously wore whatever was on sale. Now doing 25-30 mpw training for a half marathon. Narrowed it down to Hoka or Brooks but overwhelmed by options. Thoughts?\n\n---\n\nu/shoe_nerd_2020:\nDepends what you want:\n- Maximum cushion: Hoka Bondi or Brooks Glycerin\n- Balanced/versatile: Hoka Clifton or Brooks Ghost\n- Light stability: Hoka Arahi or Brooks Adrenaline GTS\n\nGhost is probably the safest choice for most people.\n\n---\n\nu/marathoner_at_50:\nI've run in both brands extensively. Key differences:\n- Hoka has more rocker, propels you forward\n- Brooks is more traditional, stable platform\n- Hoka runs narrow, Brooks fits wider\n\nAt 50, I prefer Brooks Ghost for daily training and Hoka Clifton for long runs.\n\n---\n\nu/running_physio:\nPT who works with many runners over 40. Both brands are excellent. The most important thing is fit. Common issues I see:\n- Hoka Bondi: Too soft for some, causes instability\n- Brooks Ghost: Great all-rounder but not enough cushion for joint issues\n- Hoka Clifton: Sweet spot for many older runners\n\nGet fitted at a specialty store.\n\n---\n\nu/experienced_40plus:\nMy rotation at 47:\n1. Brooks Ghost - daily trainer\n2. Hoka Mach - tempo/speed days\n3. Saucony Triumph - long runs\n\nDon't limit yourself to one brand. Mix and match.\n\n---\n\nu/ultrarunner_mom:\n52F here, running ultras. Hoka Speedgoat for trails, Brooks Glycerin for roads. The Glycerin is incredibly plush - more cushioned than the Ghost. Worth the extra money if you do lots of long runs.\n\n---\n\nu/newrunner_44 (OP):\nThanks all! Sounds like Ghost is the safe bet. Will try Clifton too for comparison. Appreciate the PT input - will definitely get fitted.\n\n---\n\nu/comeback_runner_46:\nJust my experience: tried Hoka Bondi, too unstable for me. Switched to New Balance 1080 and love it. Sometimes the most popular isn't best for you.\n\n---\n\nu/budget_runner_42:\nHey OP, also check previous year models for discounts. Ghost 14 and Clifton 8 are often $100 or less. Same great shoes.",
