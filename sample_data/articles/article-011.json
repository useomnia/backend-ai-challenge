  "content": "The New Balance Fresh Foam 1080 has long been a favorite for runners seeking plush cushioning and excellent width options. Version 13 continues the tradition with refinements.\n\nWhat's New\nThe 1080v13 features an updated Fresh Foam X midsole with more foam volume than previous versions. The Hypoknit upper is redesigned for better breathability while maintaining structure. New outsole pattern improves grip.\n\nThe Ride Experience\nImmediately noticeable: this shoe is soft. The Fresh Foam X provides a cloud-like feel that absorbs impact beautifully. Unlike some soft shoes, it doesn't bottom out on hard landings. There's adequate rebound to keep legs fresh.\n\nThe rocker geometry promotes smooth transitions without the extreme rockered feel of Hoka. It's natural and efficient. My gait felt unforced.\n\nFit Notes\nNew Balance shines in width options. Available in:\n- Narrow (B)\n- Standard (D)\n- Wide (2E)\n- Extra Wide (4E)\n\nAs someone with wide feet, finding properly fitting shoes is a constant struggle. The 1080v13 in 2E width fits perfectly. The toe box is generous, the midfoot secure, and the heel locks in place.\n\nStandard width is true to size but may feel snug to those with even slightly wide feet. If in doubt, go wide.\n\nPerformance by Activity\n- Easy runs: Excellent - plush and protective\n- Long runs: Excellent - consistent cushioning\n- Tempo runs: Adequate - not built for speed but handles moderate pace\n- Recovery: Excellent - perfect for tired legs\n\nDurability Concerns\nFresh Foam historically compresses faster than competitors. After 200 miles, I notice slight softening. Expected to get 350-400 miles total. Adequate but not class-leading.\n\nComparison to Competitors\nvs ASICS Gel-Nimbus 26: Similar cushioning, Nimbus feels more stable\nvs Brooks Glycerin 20: Glycerin slightly firmer, 1080 softer\nvs Hoka Bondi 8: Bondi more cushioned, 1080 more natural ride\n\nWho Should Buy\n- Runners with wide feet (best width options)\n- Those seeking plush daily trainer\n- Runners with bunions or toe issues\n- Masters runners needing joint protection\n\nWho Should Look Elsewhere\n- Narrow-footed runners (try ASICS)\n- Those wanting durability\n- Speed-focused training\n\nFinal Verdict\nThe New Balance Fresh Foam 1080v13 is the best option for wide-footed runners seeking cushioned comfort. If your feet are normal or narrow width, other options might fit better. But for those who struggle with fit, this shoe is a revelation.\n\nRating: 4.5/5 (5/5 for wide feet)\nPrice: $165",
