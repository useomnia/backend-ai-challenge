  "source_type": "comparison",
  "content": "Two iconic daily trainers compete for your rotation spot. The Nike Pegasus has been a go-to since 1983. The Brooks Ghost has dominated specialty running stores for years. Which deserves your miles?\n\nSpec Comparison\n| Spec | Nike Pegasus 40 | Brooks Ghost 15 |\n|------|-----------------|------------------|\n| Weight | 8.6 oz (W) | 9.1 oz (W) |\n| Drop | 10mm | 12mm |\n| Stack | 33mm heel | 35mm heel |\n| Price | $130 | $140 |\n| Cushion | React + Zoom Air | DNA LOFT v2 |\n\nCushioning Philosophy\nThe Pegasus uses a combo of React foam and Zoom Air units. This creates a bouncy, responsive feel. You feel the ground but with protection. Good for varied paces.\n\nThe Ghost uses DNA LOFT v2 - a softer, more adaptive foam. It molds to your stride and provides consistent cushioning across temperatures. Feels plush but not mushy.\n\nFor older runners, the Ghost's softer cushioning typically provides better joint protection. The Pegasus is better if you want to feel fast occasionally.\n\nWinner: Brooks Ghost 15 for cushioning comfort; Nike Pegasus 40 for responsiveness\n\nFit\nThe Pegasus 40 improved its fit from the 39. Roomier toe box, better heel lockdown. Still slightly narrow through the midfoot. Works for medium width feet.\n\nThe Ghost fits wider overall. Accommodating toe box, generous midfoot. Available in multiple widths. Better for runners with wider feet or who prefer extra room.\n\nWinner: Brooks Ghost 15 for most foot types\n\nVersatility\nThe Pegasus handles easy runs, long runs, and tempo efforts well. The Zoom Air adds energy for picking up pace. Nike designed it as a true all-rounder.\n\nThe Ghost excels at easy and moderate paces. It can handle tempo runs but feels heavy when pushing pace. Better as a pure trainer than race shoe.\n\nWinner: Nike Pegasus 40\n\nDurability\nBoth are durable. Expect 450-500 miles. The Ghost's DNA LOFT may compress slightly faster, but the outsole holds up well. The Pegasus React foam is resilient.\n\nWinner: Tie\n\nValue\nAt $130 vs $140, Pegasus is slightly cheaper. Both are frequently discounted. Either is solid value.\n\nWinner: Nike Pegasus 40 (marginally)\n\nRecommendation for Women Over 40\nMost masters runners prefer the Ghost for its cushioning and accommodating fit. The Pegasus suits those who still want some speed in their daily trainer.\n\nOur Pick\nBrooks Ghost 15 for comfort-focused runners.\nNike Pegasus 40 for versatile trainers who want responsiveness.",
