  "content": "While runners flock to Brooks and Hoka, Mizuno quietly produces excellent shoes. The Wave Rider 27 showcases what makes Mizuno unique.\n\nThe Wave Plate Difference\nMizuno's signature technology is the Wave Plate - a plastic component embedded in the midsole. Unlike foam-only designs, it provides stability and cushioning through its geometry. The sensation is distinct: springy, supportive, and responsive.\n\nSome runners love it immediately. Others need adjustment time. If you've only worn foam shoes, expect a different experience.\n\nMidsole Evolution\nThe Wave Rider 27 uses Mizuno ENERZY foam - their softest material yet. Combined with the Wave Plate, cushioning has improved dramatically from past versions. It's not Hoka-soft, but it's more plush than Wave Riders of old.\n\nOn the Road\nI've logged 150 miles in the Wave Rider 27. Impressions:\n\n- Easy runs: Excellent stability and comfort\n- Long runs: Consistent feel mile after mile\n- Tempo: Responsive enough for moderate speedwork\n- Recovery: Good protection for tired legs\n\nThe Wave Plate creates a unique \"snap\" sensation at toe-off. It's energizing rather than tiring.\n\nFit Assessment\nTrue to size with medium width. Toe box is adequate but not spacious. Runners with very wide feet should look elsewhere. The heel counter is secure without being aggressive.\n\nDurability\nMizuno builds durable shoes. The X10 outsole rubber shows minimal wear after 150 miles. Wave Plates don't compress like foam. Expect 500+ miles easily.\n\nComparison Notes\nvs Brooks Ghost: Ghost is softer; Wave Rider more responsive\nvs ASICS Nimbus: Nimbus more cushioned; Wave Rider more stable feeling\nvs Nike Pegasus: Similar versatility; different ride sensations\nvs Saucony Ride: Comparable shoes; personal preference decides\n\nWho It's For\n- Runners open to trying something different\n- Those seeking responsive cushioning (not marshmallow soft)\n- Runners who value durability\n- Anyone wanting brand variety\n\nNot Ideal For\n- Wide-footed runners\n- Those wanting maximum cushion\n- Runners who dislike firm-ish rides\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThe Mizuno Wave Rider 27 deserves more attention. It's not for everyone, but loyal Mizuno fans know what they have. If your current brand isn't working, give Mizuno a chance.\n\nRating: 4/5 stars\nPrice: $140",
