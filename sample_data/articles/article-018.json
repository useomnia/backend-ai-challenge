  "content": "The Adidas Ultraboost has straddled the line between running shoe and lifestyle sneaker since 2015. The latest Ultraboost Light aims to reclaim running credibility. Does it succeed?\n\nThe BOOST Legacy\nAdidas's BOOST foam revolutionized cushioning when introduced. The thermoplastic polyurethane pellets provide exceptional energy return. However, as competitors evolved, Ultraboost fell behind for serious runners while becoming a streetwear icon.\n\nWhat's New in Ultraboost Light\nAdidas lightened the shoe significantly - down to 10.5 oz from previous versions' 11+ oz. The BOOST midsole remains but with optimized geometry. The Primeknit+ upper is refined for better lockdown.\n\nRunning Experience\nTested over 80 miles, the Ultraboost Light surprises. The BOOST foam feels lively and protective. Cushioning is substantial without being mushy. Energy return is noticeable on faster efforts.\n\nHowever, it still runs warm due to dense Primeknit. Summer runners may struggle. The fit remains snug through the midfoot - consider sizing up.\n\nCompared to Running-First Brands\nAgainst Brooks Ghost: Ghost fits better, more versatile\nAgainst Hoka Clifton: Clifton lighter, more breathable\nAgainst ASICS Nimbus: Nimbus more cushioned, better for long runs\nAgainst New Balance 1080: 1080 better width options\n\nThe Ultraboost Light isn't best-in-class for any running metric. But it's competent and looks great.\n\nThe Fashion Factor\nLet's be honest: Ultraboost looks better than most running shoes. If you want shoes that work for running AND casual wear, this makes sense. Pure runners should look elsewhere.\n\nWho Should Buy\n- Runners who value aesthetics\n- Casual joggers wanting one versatile shoe\n- Adidas brand loyalists\n- Those running 20 mpw or less\n\nWho Should Skip\n- Serious marathon trainers\n- Runners needing wide sizes\n- Hot climate runners\n- Value-focused buyers ($190 price)\n\nVerdict\nThe Adidas Ultraboost Light is a good running shoe surrounded by great ones. For fashion-conscious casual runners, it works. For performance-focused training, Brooks, ASICS, or Hoka serve you better.\n\nRating: 3.5/5 stars\nPrice: $190",
